# First React Query
Read this article and got interested in trying React Query - [https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-start-using-react-query-4869e3d5680d](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-start-using-react-query-4869e3d5680d)

## Purpose of React Query
"This library will help you to fetch, synchronize, update, and cache your remote data while also reducing the amount of code you need to write by providing you two simple hooks and one utility function."

## Steps
- npx create-react-app - (Node v14.18.2)
- npm i react-query react-query-devtools uuid
- moved default Header to a Header component with CSS styling as a CSS module
- created UserList component with React Query userQuery to load data (loading, error, data)
- wrote utils/api to get default user list from jsonplaceholder
- added localStorage support to cache user list
- wrote ADD functionality to use React Query mutator
- deploy content to Netlify
  - "By default, React Query Devtools are only included in bundles when process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development', so you don't need to worry about excluding them during a production buil" - [https://react-query.tanstack.com/devtools](https://react-query.tanstack.com/devtools)
- add meta title, description
- redesign UI

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
